  - `GET /api/categories/` - List all categories
  
- **Authenticated endpoints** (get token first):
  - `POST /api/auth/register/` - Create user account
  - `POST /api/auth/login/` - Get JWT token
  - `POST /api/products/` - Create product
  - `PUT /api/products/{id}/` - Update product

### **3. Sample Data Verification**
- Check that you have 500+ products and 200+ users
- Verify categories are properly populated
- Test search functionality: `/api/products/?search=iphone`
