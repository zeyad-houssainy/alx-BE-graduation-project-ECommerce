# This file contains the WSGI configuration required to serve up your
# web application at http://zeyadhoussainy.pythonanywhere.com/
# It works by setting the variable 'application' to a WSGI handler of some
# description.

# +++++++++++ GENERAL DEBUGGING TIPS +++++++++++
# getting imports and sys.path right can be fiddly!
# We've tried to collect some general tips here:
# https://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/DebuggingImportError



# +++++++++++ VIRTUALENV +++++++++++
# If you want to use a virtualenv, set its path on the web app setup tab.
# Then come back here and import your application object as per the
# instructions below


# +++++++++++ CUSTOM WSGI +++++++++++
# If you have a WSGI file that you want to serve using PythonAnywhere, perhaps
# in your home directory under version control, then use something like this:
#
#import sys
#
#path = '/home/zeyadhoussainy/path/to/my/app
#if path not in sys.path:
#    sys.path.append(path)
#
#from my_wsgi_file import application  # noqa


# +++++++++++ DJANGO +++++++++++
# To use your own django app use code like this:
import os
import sys
#
## assuming your django settings file is at '/home/zeyadhoussainy/alx-BE-graduation-project-ECommerce/ecommerce_api/settings.py'
## and your manage.py is is at '/home/zeyadhoussainy/alx-BE-graduation-project-ECommerce/manage.py'
path = '/home/zeyadhoussainy/alx-BE-graduation-project-ECommerce'
if path not in sys.path:
    sys.path.append(path)
#
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'ecommerce_api.settings'  # FIXED: Changed from 'alx-BE-graduation-project-ECommerce.settings'
#
## then:
from django.core.wsgi import get_wsgi_application
application = get_wsgi_application()
