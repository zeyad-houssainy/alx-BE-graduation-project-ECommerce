- [ ] Test environment variable loading

### 3. Initial Deployment
- [ ] Trigger first deployment
- [ ] Monitor build process
- [ ] Check build logs for errors
- [ ] Verify deployment success

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Test API endpoints
- [ ] Verify database connections
- [ ] Check static file serving
- [ ] Test admin interface
- [ ] Verify SSL/HTTPS is working
- [ ] Check application logs

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

## üéØ Final Verification

Before considering deployment complete:

1. **All checklist items are checked**
2. **Application is accessible via Railway URL**
3. **All API endpoints are working**
4. **Database operations are successful**
5. **Static files are loading properly**
6. **Admin interface is accessible**
7. **SSL/HTTPS is working**
8. **No critical errors in logs**

## üö® Emergency Rollback

If deployment fails:
